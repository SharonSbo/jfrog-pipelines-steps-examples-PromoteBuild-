A Pipelines **[Step](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pipelines+Steps)** is a unit of execution in a pipeline. It is triggered by some event and uses resources to perform an action as part of the pipeline.

Most of the steps that Pipelines supports are provided as examples here. To use these examples, go to the folder for the native step you are interested in and fork it.
