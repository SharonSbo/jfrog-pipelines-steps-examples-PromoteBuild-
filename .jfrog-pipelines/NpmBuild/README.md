The NpmBuild native step builds an npm source. This step automatically performs npm-install on the source in a Git repository. 

This example  shows you how to run a simple Npm build and publish pipeline. For instructions on how to run this sample and  explanation of configuration, please reference JFrog Pipelines Quickstart documentation: [Pipelines Example: Npm Build](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pipeline+Example%3A+Npm+Build)
