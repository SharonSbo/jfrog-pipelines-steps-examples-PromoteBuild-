This sample uses two Pipelines native steps:

- **DockerBuild**: The DockerBuild native step performs a build to produce a Docker image from a Dockerfile in a GitRepo source repository resource. For more information, see https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/DockerBuild.
- **DockerPush**: The DockerPush native step pushes a Docker Image to a Docker registry. For more information, see https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/DockerPush.

Detailed instructions on how to run this sample, as well as explanation of the configuration, is in the JFrog Pipelines Quickstart documentation: [Pipeline Example: Docker Build and Push](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pipeline+Example%3A+Docker+Build+and+Push).
